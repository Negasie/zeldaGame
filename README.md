First Attempt




I am going to recreate the first dungeon rooms from Zelda for NES. If all goes well, I am going to recreate the whole dungeon, with various enemies and everything. The character will start with just a sword, perhaps I will try to add the boomerang as well.


Pseudo.

1. 	Build a grid.
2. 	Define the outer walls of the grid.
3. 	Instatiate main character onto the grid.
4. 	Define movement keys for my character around the grid.
5. 	Instatiate enemy character.
6. 	Define random movement for enemy character.
7. 	Create attack function for main character.
8. 	Connect attack function to the removal of enemy character (opacity to zero before removal would be cool)
9. 	add doorway(s) to the original grid.
10.	Clone original grid to expand the gameboard.
11. Randomize enemy characters and obstacles in different grids to vary the gameboard.
12. add keys/switches in the gameboard to open doorway(s)
13. Style everything.
14. Add boomerang.
15.	Add bombs, and exploding wall somewhere on one of the grids.
16.	Add music elements.
17. Design final boss with special attacks.
18. Clean up code.
